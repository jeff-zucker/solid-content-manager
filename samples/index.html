    Solside - a simple IDE and file manager for Solid
</title></head><body>

<h1>Welcome	to Solside</h1>
<h2>a simple IDE and file manager for Solid</h2>
<p class="no-indent">
Solside	provides a simple way to browse, edit, and manage files and folders
on a Solid data store.  You are using it now. You can see a directory listing 
of the Solid data store this app lives in on the left. Feel free to explore the
files and directories. If you were me, you could edit the files.
If you don't already have one,  <a target="blank" href="https://solidcommunity.net/register">get
your own data store</a>, and use Solside to login and edit your files. 
When you've had a chance to use it, please <a target="_blank" 
href="mailto:dubzed@gmail.com">send feedback</a>.

<h3>About the Data Browser</h3>
<p>
   The data browser is an iframed view of the Solid URL so, is exactly
   what you'd see going to the same URL directly and has all the same
   functionality.  This means you always see your edits the way everyone
   else will see them and also that you have access to all of the
   tools in the data browser.
</p>

<h3>Navigating Solid data</h3>
<p>
  If you navigate using the file menu or URL bar, the data browser
  will be refreshed each time and therefore always be in sync with
  the file manager.  If you navigate using the data browser, however,
  it will become out of sync with the file manager.  Selecting a
  new resource in the file manager will bring the data browser back
  in sync.  Or if you want to sync in the other direction, right click
  any url in the data browser, copy the url and paste it into the
  file manager's URL bar.  That will make the file manager catch up
  to your data browser location.
</p>

<h3>About Access Rights</h3>
<p>
    Although I am working on an ACL-aware version, the current version
    does only a simple owner check.  Rights are always visible in the
    interface: the file/folder icons are only green if you have rights
    to Control the folder; the save-edits button is only green if you
    are visiting a resource for which you have Write privileges; the
    options button is only green if you are logged in.
</p>

<h3>About logins</h3>
<p>
    The logins for Solside and the iframed data browser are separate,
    log in or out of both or either as desired.  The login is a popup so check
    your popup blocker if you don't see it.
